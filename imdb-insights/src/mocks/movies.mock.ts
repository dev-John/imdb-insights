        "I have never watched a show that is as consistently genuine and engaging as Breaking Bad. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest shows ever, and it consistently improves as it progresses.\n\nThe Journeys of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are unforgettable. These are some of the best-written characters to ever come from a pen-hitting paper.\n\nMy praises for the acting and cinematography are unending. Some of the shots are intricate works of art, and I was rarely distracted by the acting. The performances are excellent to the extent that it feels improper to refer to them as performances.\n\nOverall, Breaking Bad consistently maintains a level of engagement and technical quality seen in only the best of movies, and in terms of tone, every intense moment is executed with excellence and always achieves the impact it reaches for.\n\nI feel like the show's plot in the early seasons lacks a certain level of complexity due to it not having a vast amount of plot threads, and the start is a bit slow-paced, but Breaking Bad is an absolute must-watch. If you have mixed feelings towards Season 1, trust me, it is only uphill from there.\n\nIf there was ever a series you could call perfect, I think this might be it.",

        "Breaking Bad is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the greatest tv shows ever created...it's damn near perfect! I know that people say that about a ton of different shows but Breaking Bad really is universally thought of as one of the greatest shows of all-time. All you have to do is go google \"greatest tv shows of all-time\" and I guarantee you that it's at or near the top of every list you'll find and there's a reason for that...because it is! Every season is just as brilliant as the others, which everyone knows is almost impossible for a show to do but one which Breaking Bad absolutely pulls off!! If you're one of the few people who still haven't seen this amazing show then do yourself a favor and go watch this immediately...you will not be disappointed!",

        "'Breaking Bad' is one of the most popular rated shows on IMDb, is one of those rarities where every season has either been very positively received or near-universally acclaimed critically and where all of my friends have said nothing but great things about.\n\nVery few shows in recent memory had me so hooked from the very start that before the week was over the whole show had been watched, especially when for a lot of shows now airing watching one episode all the way through can be an endeavour. 'Breaking Bad' had that effect on me, and its reputation as one of the best, consistently brilliant and most addictive shows in many years (maybe even ever) is more than deserved in my eyes. Its weakest season is perhaps the first season, understandable as any show's first season is the one where things are still settling.\n\nActually everything is established remarkably from the very start, but once the writing and characterisation becomes even meatier the show reaches even higher levels.\n\nVisually, 'Breaking Bad' is one of those shows that is both stylish and beautiful, with photography and editing that are cinematic quality and put a lot of films today to shame, where there are a lot of visually beautiful ones but also some painfully amateurish looking ones. The music always has the appropriate mood, never too intrusive, never too muted.\n\nThe writing for 'Breaking Bad' is a fine example to all shows of how to have a lot of style but also to have a lot of substance. The dialogue throughout is thought-provoking and tense, while also have a darkly wicked sense of humour and heart-tugging pathos. The stories are texturally rich, intimate, tense and layered, with the pace of them consistently deliberate but taut. The direction couldn't be better.\n\nCan't say anything bad about the acting. Bryan Cranston is phenomenal as one of the most fascinating anti-heroes, or even of any kind of character, in either film or television. Aaron Paul has never been better and Anna Gunn is affecting. The characters are compelling in their realism.\n\nOverall, describing it as brilliant doesn't do 'Breaking Bad' justice. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

It's honestly a show that get's better each time you view it. It's cathartic to see Walter break bad and how the story unravels is the best way it could have. Very good storytelling, well done to Vince Gilligan.",

        "If you are among the few who haven't seen it yet: believe the hype, it really is THAT good. Breaking Bad may not depict reality the way 'Generation Kill' or 'The Wire' did - but then it's not about that, either. From an artistic point of view - performances, writing, direction, camera, music - this show is every bit as good as the other two mentioned above, but unlike those, 'Breaking Bad' just wants to entertain and therefore enjoys a lot more creative freedom.\n\nThe show plays like the daydream fantasy of any underachieving, struggling middle class family man who's had to bury all his dreams (I mean: who wouldn't want to be a meth-kingpin for a little while?), before it turns into a nightmare. One could almost say that 'Heisenberg' is Walter White's 'Tyler Durden'(for those who don't get the reference: watch 'Fight Club' - you won't regret it).\n\nFor pure entertainment value, this is simply the best show I've ever seen. Every single one of the main characters has already reached the status of a screen icon - when does that ever happen?! Most fun I've ever had watching a TV-show and an instant classic.",

        "I'd put off watching BREAKING BAD for years and years, not being particularly interested in a contemporary story about a couple of drug dealers, but I needn't have worried. This is a series that lives up to all the accolades, just as involving and gripping as I'd hoped. About half a dozen actors give career best performances as characters that evolve slowly and realistically over five seasons, and the depth is incredible, along with the refusal to paint a single person in black and white. Humour, suspense, action and the depths of the human existence being frequently explored; there's really nothing better.",

I love this show so much that I've already watched it all the way through twice already and plan on doing so again sometime in the near future.

        "This serie is unique. This is somehow realistic and amazing also. Even if you're going to watch for find the flaws, I bet you can't find real major flaws in this serie. You know some people are just tries to find nonsense things in contents. (I mean in a movie or TV show) They are hard to pleased but even those people can enjoy this serie, because they really can't find one easily.\n\nI don't know how Vince Gilligan think this serie. It is real complicated and amazing story. He's a true genius that deserves so much more. He shared the golden age of TV Shows with Game of Thrones. It is best crime, drama TV series possible. And it ended with the best way possible.\n\nThe actings are quite remarkable. I don't know how we were'nt know the name Bryan Cranston, I don't know how he didn't became a big star before this show. Giancarlo Esposito, Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn Jonathan Bakns and Bob Odenkirk is also pretty amazing. Nearly all cast did a perfect job.\n\nCinematography is so good in this serie. Not only looks great but also brings realistic style with that shaking camera sequences. You feel the moment with silence.\n\nCostume Design is also underrated. Did you know that characters has his own colors that reflects his personality? I know, it isn't a secret, many people know that but it really is something great.\n\nAlso makeups are pretty good, did you know Bryan Cranston had hair when he's bald? Yes there was hair behind that. I know it's not that hard thing to do, It's not magic. But also wounded characters are too realistic. Especially Jesse's wounded face.",

        '"Breaking Bad" is the best television show. Ever.\n\nWe start out with one main character, Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston), who is struggling to make ends meet working both as a high school chemistry teacher and part time at a car wash. Then he gets diagnosed with cancer. Then he breaks bad.\n\nTeaming up with an unlikely sidekick, Jesse Pinkman (played by Aaron Paul), who is the immature "yo, bitch"-spouting, high-school-screw-up small-time drug dealer, Walt and Jesse both put their skills towards the drug world to try to make good by their families.\n\nThis show has been masterfully put together with layer upon layer of insight into some of the most interesting characters ever realized in the history of television. We have some very dark characters, and a lot of grey characters, and it all adds up to brilliant dialogue and plot lines.\n\nThe creator, writers, directors and actors have paid attention to every single detail, putting thought into every nuance in every character in every scene. Because of this attention to detail there is something for everyone in this show. Every thinking brain will immediately be attracted to the intelligence so evidently on display, that even if you\'re not a drug dealing chemist living in Albuquerque, you will find something in the characters that connects you to them and makes you hang on for dear life.\n\nGet on your couch now and start watching "Breaking Bad" from the very beginning, and don\'t miss a single scene.',

        'BREAKING BAD:Season One explodes like a sucker punch to the gut, and is nothing short of mind-blowing. The pilot for this series is a definite "Must See", and stands with the greats of Action/Adventure Television and Cinema. This segment begins at such a giddy peak, that you think the only way forward would be to tell the tale as a long flashback. However, through a marvelous piece of editing and writing, the plot miraculously moves forward from that point. Bryon Cranston\'s idiosyncratic performance is a joy to behold. He embodies a man who is against a rock, and an even harder place, who has no other option but to throttle his higher aspirations and grimly carry on. His solace and validation in middle-class morality and virtuous conduct is long gone. I eagerly look forward to more of this ambitious, entertaining series.',

        'Review of Season One:\n\nThis is one of those shows I missed the first time around but was eager to catch up with having heard so many good things. Having just watched the short first season, I can report I love it. It starts off strongly with no messing about, and then delves deep into character work for a few episodes before bringing it back on a high at the climax. The acting is of a very fine calibre and the elements of blacker-than-black humour add immeasurably to the entertainment value. A good show all round, and I look forward to seeing where they take it from here.',

        "It's hard for me to be super objective about this show. Over the course of 62 episodes, right from the start, for me, Vince Gilligan and his team of writers and directors crafted a piece of neo-noir-western American tragedy that almost never, if ever, lost its footing. In its story of the rise and fall of Walter White (or his fun alias Heisenberg) and how he becomes a Meth \"Emperor\" in Albuquerque during his run of lung cancer, we get all kinds of dramaturgy here. There's conflict, conflict, conflict going on in this show, always, from the familial (what do I tell my wife, Skylar, or not tell her, what doesn't she tell me, how far do the lies and deceit and horrors go?) to the more genre-leaning (how much criminals go in their crazy s***, which is established early on with the throw of the particular chemical and the \"This... is not Meth\" explosion) to the dark comedy that gives the Coens a run for their money (Better Call Saul!) - not to mention how it made Aaron Paul just as much as star as Bryan Cranston, both working actors along with Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Betsy Brandt and Bob Odenkirk. It all... fits.\n\nOften with a show it's easy to let things slip, even (or especially) on the great shows when it comes to character dynamics, repetition, things that can be hard to control over the space of such a long period of time. But everything is so carefully mapped out, season after season, for the unpredictable to keep happening and for the dramatic beats to gain tension and mystery. Just take how the writers set up, so patiently, over a season, the opening clues of objects and debris all outside of a house, and when you finally find out what all this is about - BAM right to the gut.\n\nWhat one comes away with, outside of the tremendous performances (you might gripe that Cranston got too many Emmys, but... what didn't he deserve with every fiber of his acting bad-assery?) and the consequences that are built up for all the characters, including those we think are made of rock and steel (Mike Erhmantraut), is the world of moral terror. What is morality in this world? There isn't any. It's the Wild West, but crossed with something like, I dunno, American Beauty. What happens when you take a hardcore drug-gangster tale of suspense and warp it with dark comedy about what it means to be a man in society today, or what it means to have a family (and believe me, there are many moments that are downright haunting, harrowing to the soul that speak to this, especially as it builds and builds in its last eight episodes)? You get... this. Perfection.\n\nI wish I could tell you there's problems with the show, but rarely can I find any. I'm sure if I dug deep enough some might be there, a cliché exploited for the drug-war scenarios or having a baby around for easy drama or theatrics. But so many times on this show you - or I should say I - get thrown curve balls that really have no other way of working out except how they do. When a moment like Walter White in his crawl space discovering a terrible revelation and going from agony to abhorrent laughter arrives, it's just one of those amazing moments of drama in any American medium. It might be throwing praise like gravy on a Thanksgiving platter, but I'm reminded of Nicholson's comment once on Kubrick: everyone acknowledges he's the man, and I still think that underrates him.",

        "Often hailed as one of the greatest TV ever made, Breaking Bad lives up to the hype. You will be hard pressed to watch a show that is as well shot, directed, acted, and written. Being a finite series, the story told feels complete, compelling, and doesn't drag out into unnecessary and disappointing filler episodes. Every minute of this series is masterfully crafted and designed to encapsulate the viewer into a once in a lifetime experience. Instantly becoming a classic must-watch show, I cannot name anything that I would have wanted different. If you haven't yet seen it, you've been missing out and I hope you take the time to experience such a perfect show.",

        "Drug wars, meth, the lot. I thought no thank you. I kept hearing how good it was and I kept saying: \"No thank you\" Last January I got sick, one of those illnesses you can't quite figure out. Maybe it was pre and post election depression, I don't know. But I stayed in bed for almost 10 days and then it happened. I saw the first episode and I was immediately and I mean immediately, hooked. I saw the entire series in 9 days. Voraciously. Now I had time to reflect. Why I wonder. When I think about it the first thing that comes to mind is not a thing it's Bryan Cranston. I know the concept was superb as was the writing but Bryan Cranston made it all real. His performance, the creation of Walter White will be studied in the Acting classes of the future. He is the one that pulls you forward - as well as backwards and sideways - then I realized that his creation acquired the power that it acquired, in great part thanks to the extraordinary cast of supporting players. I could write a page for each one of them but I'm just going to mention Aaron Paul. I ended up loving him. I developed a visceral need to see him find a way out. Well, what can I tell you. I know that one day, maybe when my kids are old enough, I shall see \"Breaking Bad\" again. I can't wait.",

        "Despite me not caring much about modern television at all, there are very few shows that have the lasting effect that Breaking Bad has had on me. I first watched it around early 2017 and was never the same afterwards. Compelling characters, an interesting and elaborate story spanning over 60 hour long episodes, great musical selections, cinematography and countless other things. I wouldn't say I'm one of those obsessed fans that will watch the show multiple times, but I felt the need to revisit this series 6 years later since I have a much better understanding of tv shows and film than I did then. It's not hard to be enamored with this show and I'd be lying if I said I looked at each one of its episodes analytically back then. All I cared about at the time was how amazing it was. I'll try my best to explain the show's premise, but unlike most other things I discuss, I can't delve far into the plot. Each episode is quite confusing and they all build on each other, so the only way to comprehend the story entirely is to simply watch the show.\n\nBreaking Bad is centered around a high school chemistry teacher living in New Mexico named Walter White (Bryan Cranston). In the very first episode, he is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. He tells his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn), son, Walter Junior (RJ Mitte), and brother-in-law Hank (Dean Norris), who is also a Drug Enforcement Association agent. One day, Walt joins Hank on a drug bust and is shocked to discover Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), a former student of his, is running his own drug lab. Jesse is, in most people's eyes, a loser, but Walter sees an opportunity that will benefit both of them. Walt's scientific intelligence is far beyond what his job requires him to know, so he makes Jesse an offer he can't refuse: the two of them will synthesize methamphetamine so that Walt can leave his family a huge fortune before he dies. Walter will handle the chemical aspects of the job while Jesse finds methods of distributing it. The meth Walter comes up with is the most chemically pure ever seen in the US and is nicknamed Blue Sky. Having a new sense of fearlessness (since he is going to be dead soon anyway), Walter throws himself (and Jesse) into the criminal underworld by selling their new drug, and along the way narrowly manage to escape both law enforcement and the guns of the lowlives they sell to. He also adopts the alias of Heisenberg. Despite breaking the law in order to provide for his family, Walt makes it clear to Jesse that he never really wanted this. He doesn't want to know anything about their customers and doesn't care about them. As the show progresses, Walter goes from a mild mannered teacher to a multi-millionaire kingpin who always manages to dispose of his enemies in one way or another. This is where the show's first great aspect makes itself known, as Breaking Bad has some of the best character development you'll ever see. Walter and Jesse are both very dynamic and go through many phases over the course of the show. The show is realism itself as basically all the characters (barring children) are shown to be guilty of at least one thing. Walter's illegal drug business manages to stay hidden from his family for the longest time via a complex series of lies, all complicated by the fact that Hank is tracking down an unknown meth cook who is actually his brother-in-law. While in my opinion this viewpoint is mostly misplaced, tons of people who watch this show feel that Jesse is the most morally sound character. He may be a junkie and unwilling to listen to his parents who want to see him turn his life around, but he really does care about children and harming one is a surefire way to send him into a savage rage. Starting in the second season, he undergoes a lot of development as he rents an apartment managed by Jane (Krysten Ritter), a former heroin addict. As their relationship progresses, so do their self-destructive habits. Jane finds out from Jesse that Walter is basically a druglord, and begins to turn Jesse against him. Eventually, this culminates in her blackmailing Walter for around half a million dollars, but Walter arrives with the money in the midst of both of them out cold from doing heroin. Walter watches Jane overdose and chooses not to do anything. Jesse later discovers his girlfriend is dead, and with her, his whole reason for living. The show starts to hit its stride in season 3, as we get introduced to two crucial new characters, Mike and Gus (Jonathan Banks and Giancarlo Esposito respectively). Mike is probably my favorite character, as he is a family man like Walter but unlike Jesse, is able to see Walt for the monster he is rapidly becoming. He is head of corporate security for his boss, Gustavo Fring. Gus represents a huge change of pace when compared to other villains the show has seen so far. A far cry from psychopaths like Tuco (a madman who would beat his own guards to a pulp after doing meth), Gus is an imposing, extremely intelligent and calculating man. If you've never seen the show, the best person I can compare him to is Pablo Escobar. Gus is essentially Walter's equal. He hides in plain sight, is the mastermind behind a gargantuan drug trade in the southwestern US, and even owns a fast food chain that sells chicken (for money laundering). He's the type of person to come to your table and ask if the food is to your liking, but behind the scenes, nobody crosses him and lives. Almost never caught off guard, he, Jesse and Walter come into contact multiple times and even work for him at one point, manufacturing meth in an enormous underground lab concealed beneath a laundromat. Designed for the production of industrial amounts of illegal drugs, the legitimate establishment above it receives large deliveries of various chemicals regularly, so there is no suspicion. Just to emphasize the amount Walt is able to make compared to the show's early stages, he and Jesse were initially only able to make about 4 pounds of methamphetamine per session. The super lab allows the production of 400 pounds a week, since Gus' drug trade is a business that runs on a tight schedule.\n\nBy the time of the fourth season, Breaking Bad (and Walter) are at the top of their games. Skyler, widely considered to be an obnoxious and overly emotional wife, ultimately becomes complicit in her husband's atrocious acts and launders his money. Despite being prone to sappiness, she does bring up good points as the series progresses, such as how \"someone needs to protect this family from the man who protects this family.\" She is little more than Walt's hostage, and his actions and lies have brought carnage and misfortune to both foes and friends alike. He is constantly trying to throw off Hank's investigation to make sure his other life is never known to him, which gets more and more difficult as Hank and the DEA gather clues, and Walt's actions keep inadvertently getting numerous people killed. The show's fifth season, usually considered the best, shows Walter completely forgetting his old way of life and fully immersing himself in the drug trade. Originally he was doing it to have money for his family, but now, he's just a lunatic and never knows when to stop. Jesse strives to better himself and choose his own way in life, which leads to him realizing Walt was manipulating him. As such, the last season is full of moments where Walt and his former friend and partner are trying to kill each other, with Walt even hiring a gang of white supremacists to do so at one point. My only problem with the last season is the neo-Nazis aren't as convincing or creative as some of the other antagonists we've seen, but otherwise, season 5 is incredible. Walter loses his family and everything important to him, as his son, Skyler and everyone else realize the real Walter White is long gone. All that remains is his criminal other self: Heisenberg.\n\nOverall, I know this review has been long, but the truth is I could have gone on even more. Breaking Bad is a show that will forever change you, as it is frighteningly realistic in its portrayal of violence and how innocent people can get killed because of a man's desire to make as much money as possible. The setting of a western movie, the stylized bloodshed of Tarantino, suspense that gives Hitchcock a run for his money, events and items shown to the audience an entire season before they become relevant in the story, etc. If it rents ideas from other directors, it only does it from the best. This time around, I watched the entire thing from start to finish in a little over a week, and all of it felt new to me. There's many other moments I love from this show I could have written about, but I'd be doing that until next year. All I'll end with is this show (along with The Sopranos) is typically considered tv's apex for a reason.",

        "As the clueless, hapless and hopeless father of four on the celebrated series MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE, Bryan Cranston came into his own, as he did an amazing balancing act that juggled slapstick, pathos and insanity all at once, proving that not only did \"father NOT know best\", but more than likely never would.\n\nNow he essays the role of another father in the new series BREAKING BAD, but it's a shocking, bracingly refreshing turn that takes his 'Three Stooges' repertoire of grunts, shrieks, barks and neurotic ticks and virtually throws them out the window. Some of those qualities are still there, but unlike MALCOLM, BREAKING is the blackest of black comedies. When I first heard about it, the reviews I read compared it heavily (and favorably) to the Coen Brothers' dark crime comedy FARGO. And the comparisons are aptly warranted.\n\nThis is one of those series where the less you know about it going in, the better, but just to set your mind reeling with the possibilities, here it is in a nutshell: Cranston plays high school chemistry teacher Walter White, who is constantly battling the lackadaisical attitudes of his disinterested students, the looming specter of financial disaster - by supplementing his paltry teacher's salary with a second job at a local car wash, and trying to cope with the impending arrival of a new baby, even as he and his wife raise their disabled teenage son, whom unlike many stereotypical portrayals of handicapped kids is no Pollyanna-like angel. \n\nThen in the midst of all this, Walter makes a shocking discovery: he has inoperable lung cancer, and therefore only a few years left to live at best. Facing the very real possibility of leaving his family struggling not only with his death, but a financial situation that could only end in catastrophe, Walter suddenly has a revelation, thanks to an idea handed to him by his boorish brother-in-law, who works with the DEA - he decides to become a crystal meth dealer. \n\nOkay, so while you're letting your brain take that all in, you also need to know that this is one of those defining roles where you just know that the lead actor will get Emmy recognition, whether he intended to or not. That is just how good Cranston is as Walter. In fact, he's every bit as good as Michael C. Hall's Dexter Morgan, James Gandolfini's Tony Soprano or Harold Perrineau's criminally under-appreciated Augustus Hill. And he's backed by an amazing supporting cast of mostly new or unfamiliar faces (with the exception of Dean Norris as the brother-in-law).\n\nYou can tell from the word 'go' that writer/producer/director Vince Gilligan (former head writer/exec producer on THE X FILES) has been champing at the bit for a while to let fly with a project like this. And if the first episode is any indication, AMC has another real winner on its hands. So MAD MEN will need to move over and make some room...since BREAKING BAD isn't the kind of series to \"ask nicely.\"\n\nWhich brings up another important point: this is not a series for everyone, the way that FARGO and Showtime's kindred-spirit drug dramedy WEEDS are not mainstream, either. This is sharp, biting, satirical social commentary that draws blood when it sinks its teeth in, and you are guaranteed to wince even as you laugh out loud at Cranston's dead-on portrayal of a MAN on the edge of a nervous breakdown (well, more like over the edge.)\n\nA caveat for would-be viewers, though, and a very ironic one at that: AMC has applied its ham-fisted method of editing its movies to this series as well, unfortunately, making the channel the LAST place you want to see it. The best thing to do is to check out the premiere episode whenever you can catch a rerun on AMC, then hustle on over to iTunes and download it so you can watch it again. Some very important scenes and some impressive establishing shots have been \"edited for time and content\" from the broadcast version, and this is material that IS essential to your experience viewing this show. There is a lot more to the characters and situations than you will be allowed to see on basic cable. So as you watch, keep that in mind.\n\nAnd after you are done marveling at this magnificent character study sketched in desperation, you can wonder as I did, whether Bryan Cranston will bother preparing a speech for next year's Emmys. I sure hope he does...thanks to his work on BREAKING BAD, he'll need it.",
